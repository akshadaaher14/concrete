#  Concrete Compressive Strength Prediction using Machine Learning

##  Project Overview

The goal of this project is to **predict the compressive strength of concrete** based on its ingredients using supervised machine learning algorithms.

Concrete is one of the most widely used building materials, and predicting its strength accurately is crucial for structural safety and material optimization.


##  Business Objective

To develop a reliable predictive model that estimates the **compressive strength of concrete** given its component mix. This can assist engineers and manufacturers in:

- Reducing experimental costs
- Improving material efficiency
- Ensuring structure durability



##  Machine Learning Workflow

### 1. Dataset Overview
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository (or local CSV)
- Features:
  - Cement, Slag, Fly Ash, Water, Superplasticizer
  - Coarse Aggregate, Fine Aggregate, Age (days)
- Target:
  - Compressive Strength (MPa)

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing/null values
- Detected and removed outliers using IQR method
- Applied normalization/scaling (MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler)

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation heatmap
- Pairplots and distribution plots
- Feature-target relationship visualizations

### 4. Modeling
- Trained various regression models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Ridge & Lasso Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Metrics used:
  - R² Score
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Achieved up to **93% accuracy (R² Score)** with ensemble models
